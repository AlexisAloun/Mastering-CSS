<!--A second, and perhaps superior location, for placing
styles is the document head.
Styles in the head of the document are placed inside
a style element located in the document head.
Letâ€™s create our first style in the document head.
Just after the title element-->

    <title>A Little CSS - Embbed Style</title>
    <!--In this context h1 is called the selector and
    indicates that the style rule will be applied to all h1
    tags in the document. The rule, of course, will color
    all the h1 elements firebrick red.-->
     <style>
         h1 {
             color: firebrick;
            }
         p {
            font-size: 14pt;
            font-family: Arial;
            }
         img {
             float: right;
             margin-left: 10px;
             visibility: visible;
             border: 1px black solid;
             }
     </style>
    <!--CSS rules can apply to non-text elements as well.
    We set a style rule on our image, so the text flows
    around it better. This rule will cause the image to float on the right
    side of the text and create a 10-pixel gap between the
    text and image, giving it some breathing space.-->
