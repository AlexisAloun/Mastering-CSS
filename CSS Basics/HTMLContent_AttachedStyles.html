<!--The reason that most developers prefer to use
external stylesheets is that they can be attached to
multiple pages allowing your styles to be consistent
from page to page. External stylesheets can also
ease maintenance, as you can adjust styles from a
single location instead of page by page.-->

    <!--The link tag has two required attributes. The
    first, rel, provides the relationship of the link to
    the document itself. The value should always be
