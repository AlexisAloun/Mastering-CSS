<!--Selectors:
Tag Selectors -  Allow you to select element for styling by the tag name. For example, if we were to use h1 as a selector all of the <h1> elements in the HTML document would be selected for styling. 
ID Selectors -  Intended to be used once and only once on a page. Traditionally ID’s have been used to provide unique identifiers for content blocks within a web page. 
Class Selectors - Intended to be deployed multiple times on a page. Classes are a flexible way to select multiple content elements for formatting. 
Multiple Selectors - There are times when it’s strategic to select more than a single element at a single time. We can merely separate the individual selectors with a comma and all selectors listed will be styled. 
Descendant Selectors -  Elements that are inside other elements are said to be descendants. In this code two <h2> tags are displayed. The first is a decedent of the <header> tag. The second is a direct descendant of the <div> tag. 
Attribute Selectors -  Allow you to select an element based on the attribute that it contains. You’ll notice that the <header> element has an align attribute with a value of center. 
Pseudo-Selectors - Pseudo-Selectors are designed to modify selectors. Many pseudo-selectors are used in CSS.
